#Wrapping up


It is the final week, so let me start with some general reflections to wrap up the unit. I know some of you may think, why the hell am I learning code and stats? You may think the contents of this course may ultimately not be of direct benefit to you. But we have designed this experience in such a way that you also acquire a set of skills and tools to learn how to confront tough problems (even those you may think you hate). Life will throw many of those kind of problems at your door. Having survived this module, we believe may have also teach you a thing or two about the importance of task persistence; overcoming your frustration in order to obtain results; dealing with your own insecurites and the understandable emotions they generate; being more organised about your work; collaborate with others in the same situation; the importance of attention to detail; etc. Hopefully we may have also helped you to develop a greater sense of curiosity and to achieve the inmense satisfaction one gets when one cracks a tough problem that may have had us screaming at the computer screen for what may have felt like hours. We know a course like this may get you out of your comfort zone. But we firmly believe that it is worth it. And that you will get something out of it, even if now may not be terribly obvious to you.

And with that, let's move to this final session. We are not going to cover new techniques today. What there may be a few tips about presentation that you may find helpful. The document in Blackboard about how to write your analytical report is quite detailed already. But there a few additional tips you may find helpful. 


##Tips for the assignment


You should all now be familiar with the assignment you have to do. In the Blackboard page for this course unit you can obtain the essay question and additional guidance we have prepared. That guidance aims to answer most of the questions about what you need to do and how. It is very detailed and it has been built with the feedback from the many students that have taken this module before. That guidance aims to provide you a helping hand during the process. It also includes a file in how to think about the writing of your essay -see [here]().

Critically you have never written anything like this before so it is normal to have questions. It may help you to read any article in any of the top journals in our field such as [Criminology](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/17459125), the [Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/jrc), or if you like "hard drugs" the [Journal of Quantitative Criminology](https://link.springer.com/journal/10940) to get an idea of the templates that criminologists follow when writing a research report. **Looking at good templates** such as the ones you will encounter in those journals will give you good ideas about how to tell your story.

For any additional questions you can follow the sequential 5 "Bs" approach designed to enhance autonomy that primary schools follow these days: brain, book, board, buddy, boss. Start with the first and move to the next one if you get stuck.

+ Brain: "Do you already know the answer or is this something you can decide for yourself?"
+ Book: "Can I look back through my learning materials and find the answer there?"
+ Board: "Is the answer in the discussion board?"
+ Buddy: "Can one of my peers answer this question?" (if unconvinced by their answer you can move to the next B)
+ Boss: "If I have tried all the other Bs, then I can put up my hand but continue working" (and remember here you should first try to ask in the discussion board or the labs, and failing that make an appointment through office hours)



A scientific report, like the one you are tasked to write, needs to be clear, well justified, and very efficient in the use of space. It will be helpful you finish ahead of time and **dedicate some time simply to edit your final essay**. This is, in fact, a general piece of advice for any essay you write. But in this case perhaps matters more. You will have done loads of things as part of your analysis, but will have very limited word count to tell the story of your analysis. Every word and every sentence must be needed. There is always a shorter and more parsimonious way of saying something! And, please, use the spelling editors of whatever app you use to write your essays. It is not cool to send essays with typos and grammar errors that any app can automatically detect these days.

Here I am just going to cover a few things you can do to make this presentation a bit more succint and parsimonious.
